# Thriftshop E-Commerce Website (Edited)
Statuus - In Progress
## 📖 Overview
This project began as a second-year coursework assignment using dummy data.  
I am now improving it into a fully functional e-commerce web application that handles real requests, supports user interactions, and eliminates reliance on dummy data.  

## 🌐 Live Demo
We are currently testing the application using **ngrok**, which provides temporary URLs for demo purposes.  
Because ngrok generates a new link each time it runs, the live demo link may change.

*(This forwards to your local server at http://localhost:5000 while ngrok is running.)*
